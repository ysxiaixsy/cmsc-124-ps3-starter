;;;; evaluator.lisp -- Part 2. Write the eight functions below.
;;;;
;;;; The toy language is a Lisp-1. One namespace holds both variables and
;;;; functions, so a variable bound to a closure is callable in operator
;;;; position and (f 1) works with no FUNCALL. The CLISP hosting this file is a
;;;; Lisp-2, which is why the host needs FUNCALL and #' where the toy language
;;;; needs neither. ANALYSIS.md asks you about that difference.
;;;;
;;;; An environment is an association list: ((name . value) (name . value) ...).
;;;; The grader scores E1 to E4 separately, so finish them in order and keep
;;;; every group you get right.
;;;;
;;;; The grammar, in full:
;;;;
;;;;   expr := number
;;;;         | symbol
;;;;         | (+ expr expr) | (- expr expr) | (* expr expr)
;;;;         | (let ((name expr) ...) body)
;;;;         | (lambda (name ...) body)
;;;;         | (operator-expr argument-expr ...)

;;; E1 -- numbers and symbols.

name. Signal an error when NAME is not bound at all."

;;; E2 -- prefix arithmetic.

(defun eval-operands (exprs env)
  "Every expression in EXPRS, evaluated in the same ENV, as a list.

MAPCAR and a LAMBDA do this in one line. Watch the arity: EVAL-EXPR takes two
arguments and MAPCAR hands its function one."

in parallel and an init cannot see a name the same LET introduces."

(defun make-closure (params body env)
  "A closure over ENV.

was written in, not the one it will later be called from. Saving the wrong one
is what makes the difference between 3 and 101 in the case the manual walks
through."

number is not a cons, so the atom tests come before the list tests."
